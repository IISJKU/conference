            <p>User Centred Design and User Involvement are recognised as important success factors for implementing a
                high level of Usability and User Experience (UX) Design. This is reflected and respected e.g. in the
                work of W3C/WAI on guidelines, standards, techniques and tools for web accessibility. But methods,
                techniques and tools for user for allowing end users with disabilities to fully participate in R&D teams
                as co-researchers and experts are still missing.
                <br><br>
                User involvement in practice is still much restricted to initial user requirements studies and final
                evaluation using traditional tool as e.g. questionnaires, interviews and observation. R&D thereby still
                tends to be more "about" then "with" people with disabilities.
                <br><br>
                Recent developments and studies provide evidence on the the benefits and increased quality of R&D
                results when certain groups of people with disabilities are involved as co-researchers of owners of R&D
                projects. this holds in particular true when Assistive Technologies or Accessibility issues are at
                focus.
                <br>
                This also concerns people with cognitive disabilities, where only recently first approaches in
                inclusive, participatory and action based R&D and design have started. Increased cognitive accessibility
                is beneficial for many more users and supports general usability. Therefore, research in inclusive
                participatory R&D and design for all groups of people with disabilities are needed providing adapted or
                new processes, methods techniques and tools. This session calls for</p>
            <ul>
                <li>research and development in an inclusive and participatory R&D and design process, in particular
                    focussing on
                </li>
                <li>new and adapted methods, techniques and tools for inclusive and participatory R&D and design</li>
                <li>networking and discussing legal and ethical aspects of including more vulnerable groups in R&D and
                    design
                </li>
                <li>reports on experience from projects and R&D and design practice</li>
                <li>opinions, ideas, political and position papers</li>
                <li>new visions and horizons</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This STSs intends to provide and open and creative platform for new and innovative ideas and concepts
                both at the level of scientific research but also at the level of innovative conceptual and visionary
                ideation.

                This session is organised in the frame of the Easy Reading project, which received funding from the
                European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No.780529.

                    <p>Travellers with visual impairments may face substantial information gaps on their journeys by
                        public transport. For instance, information displayed in trains, as well as on departure boards
                        in train stations and on platforms, are often not available in acoustic or tactile form. Digital
                        technologies, such as smartphones or smartwatches, can provide an alternative means of access.
                        However, these alternatives do not guarantee that the user experience is comparable in value,
                        quality and efficiency. The present case study details a participatory design process, where
                        travellers with visual impairments co-designed a mobile app. The goal was to tackle information
                        gaps on journeys by public transport and to learn how participatory design can facilitate the
                        provision of comparable experiences for users with disabilities. Travellers with visual
                        impairments were involved in a collaborative process in all project phases, including problem
                        identification, technical feasibility, proof of concept, design and development. Participatory
                        design contributed to a thorough understanding of the user perspective and allowed the app to be
                        optimised for the needs of travellers with visual impairments. Furthermore, co-design proved to
                        be an effective method for fostering awareness and knowledge about digital accessibility at all
                        organisational levels.</p>
